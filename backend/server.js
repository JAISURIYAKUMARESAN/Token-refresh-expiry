JWT Token Refresh and Expiry

1.Aim:

The aim of the JWT Token Refresh and Expiry project is to implement secure user authentication by using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) that automatically expire after a set time and can be renewed using refresh tokens — ensuring both security and smooth user experience.
2.Features:

 User Login and Signup – Users can register and log in securely.
 Access Token Creation – A token is generated after login.
 Token Expiry – Access token expires after a short time for safety.
 Refresh Token – Used to get a new access token without logging in again.
 Logout Option – Users can log out and remove tokens.
 Secure Authentication – Passwords are encrypted, and tokens are verified.
 Error Handling – Shows proper messages for invalid or expired tokens.
3.Technologies:
